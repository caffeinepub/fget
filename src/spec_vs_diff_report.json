For REQ-1/2/3, FileList.tsx is truncated in the diff excerpt and does not show the relevant UI sections, so the requested UI restores cannot be verified from the provided evidence. Additionally, two non-requested files (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json) were modified, which violates the “No other changes” constraint.",

      "reason": "The provided diff excerpt for FileList.tsx is truncated before any row rendering / action-button logic, so there is no evidence that row actions were made always-visible or that tooltips were preserved.",

      "reason": "The diff excerpt does not include the File Browser header/top action buttons rendering; therefore there is no evidence of labeled buttons, tooltip removal, or the required ordering.",
