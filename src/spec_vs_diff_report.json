  "summary": "Diff clearly implements centralized app version constant (0.1.61) and imports it into ManagePanel. FilePreviewModal has new state and event handling for fullscreen/maximize, but the diff is truncated before showing the actual rendered viewer layout, header controls, resizing behavior, or close/Escape handling—so REQ-1..REQ-4 cannot be confirmed as implemented from the provided evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Redesign the in-app file preview UI into a more professional, player-style viewer that is mobile-friendly, opens noticeably larger by default, is responsive, and continues to support all currently previewable file types without regressions.",
      "reason": "The FilePreviewModal diff is truncated before any JSX/layout changes are shown. While file-type detection and blob/text loading logic is present, there is no visible evidence of a larger, player-style responsive viewer layout or confirmation that all preview renderers (image/video/audio/document/text/JSON) are still rendered exactly as before.",

      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add fullscreen capability with a visible toggle control in the viewer header; entering fullscreen uses maximum viewport and exiting restores prior size/state.",
      "reason": "There is evidence of fullscreen state and a fullscreenchange listener, but the diff is truncated before the UI is shown (no confirmed header toggle control, no confirmed requestFullscreen/exitFullscreen wiring, no confirmed restore behavior).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Make the viewer resizable in a user-friendly way across desktop and mobile (resize or maximize/restore + fullscreen), with content reflow and mobile-friendly layout.",
      "reason": "State and icons for maximize/minimize are present, but the diff is truncated before showing any resize/maximize controls, sizing styles, or responsive/mobile layout implementation, so resize behavior and content reflow cannot be verified.",
      "evidence": [

      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Remove duplicate close (X) controls so only one close control is shown, aligned in the viewer header; closing works via close button and Escape key (desktop) without duplication.",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated before the modal header JSX is shown; there is no visible evidence that duplicate close controls were removed or that Escape key handling is implemented/maintained without duplication.",
