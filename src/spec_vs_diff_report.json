  "summary": "The diff updates the centralized APP_VERSION to 0.3.101 and updates Footer to display it. It also adds/uses folder-navigation helpers intended to render a containing-folder-only path for search results and enable navigation from that path, and indicates restoring filename click-to-preview in search results. However, additional unrequested behavior changes appear in the search implementation (useQueries) and potentially other FileList UI/behavior beyond the two specified regressions.",

    {
      "description": "Enhanced/changed subtree search behavior (client-side recursive subtree search with Unicode-aware, case-insensitive, diacritics-insensitive matching; fixes matching descendants; full-drive search when startFolderId is null).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to restore two regressed search-result interactions (clickable containing-folder path and filename click-to-preview) and did not request any search algorithm/behavior changes.",
