  "summary": "All four requested fixes appear to be implemented: breadcrumb repositioning in FileList, restored file click-to-preview behavior, recursive subtree search now including files (including from root), and version bumped to 0.3.87 in both frontend and backend. One potentially unrequested behavioral change is indicated around folder upload semantics.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Changed folder upload semantics to only create one folder and upload immediate child files, ignoring nested subdirectories (i.e., simplified/non-recursive folder upload).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly lists changing upload behavior/folder upload semantics as a non-goal; this change is not requested and could be a regression risk.",
