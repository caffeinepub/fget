  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to frontend/src/components/FileList.tsx that address the BuildRequest requirement to remove tooltips from three view mode toggle buttons. The file summary explicitly states 'view toggle buttons (list/gallery) WITHOUT tooltips on the three selected view mode buttons' and notes that 'all existing functionality preserved' including 'right-aligned row action buttons with tooltips'. The project_state.json confirms AR-1 with REQ-1 is pending. However, the actual code changes in FileList.tsx are truncated, preventing verification of the exact implementation details.",
