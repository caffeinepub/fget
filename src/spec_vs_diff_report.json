  "summary": "All four requested UI fixes appear to be implemented: app version bumped to 0.4.119, file type labeling updated to show \"N/A\" only for no-extension filenames and otherwise use extension-derived labels, breadcrumb click affordance styling added via a shared CSS class, and filename hover tooltips restored (per FileList-related change notes). However, there are substantial unrequested global theme/color variable changes in index.css that go beyond the requested breadcrumb styling and may violate the constraint to avoid additional UI/design changes.",

      "reason": "REQ-3 only asked to adjust breadcrumb segment styling to improve click visibility without changing overall design/layout; the diff shows broad palette/theme variable changes in frontend/src/index.css that are not explicitly requested and could alter the overall look.",
