# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix file type display logic, reposition Upload Files button, restore breadcrumb navigation colors, and update version to v0.4.127.

**Planned changes:**
- Display specific file types (JSON, Folder, etc.) in Type column, showing 'N/A' for unknown types instead of the full filename
- Move Upload Files button before New Folder button with folder-style yellow border while keeping blue color scheme
- Restore blue colors in Drive path breadcrumb navigation (Drive > testup > test2 > test3)
- Bump application version to v0.4.127

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see proper file type labels or 'N/A' for unknowns, a repositioned Upload Files button with consistent styling, blue-colored breadcrumb navigation matching v0.4.121, and version v0.4.127 displayed in the footer.
