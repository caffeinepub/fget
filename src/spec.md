## Summary
**Goal:** Restore clickable path display in search results and update app version to 0.4.121.

**Planned changes:**
- Add clickable folder path/location information to each search result row in the FileList component
- Update app version constant to '0.4.121' in frontend/src/lib/appVersion.ts

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see and click on the folder path for each search result to navigate directly to the containing folder. The footer displays version 0.4.121.
