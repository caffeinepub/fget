      "text": "Fix the file search feature so typing into the File Manager search bar returns matching files/folders using case-insensitive substring matching, instead of returning no results.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "When the user enters a non-empty search term, the UI shows at least one result when there are files/folders whose names contain the term as a case-insensitive substring (e.g., \"cs\" matches \"cs.json\").",
        "When the search term is cleared, the UI returns to showing the normal folder contents list.",
        "Search works while inside a subfolder (i.e., uses the current folder as the start point for the search).",
        "No console errors are emitted during searching, and the search request is actually executed (i.e., a backend call is made via the existing search query hook)."

  "constraints": [
    "Backend must remain a single Motoko actor in backend/main.mo (no additional backend services).",
    "Do not modify files under frontend/src/components/ui or any paths listed as immutable in SYSTEM_CONTEXT."
